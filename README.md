# Patina Foundation Grants
Descriptions and requirements for grants managed under the Patina Research Foundation (patinafoundation.io)

This repository contains the requirements documents for all grants managed by the Patina Research Foundation (PRF). PRF grants are grants provided the the non-profit to individuals to further research and development of community owned projects, for the betterment of humanity as a whole.

The PRF focuses on directly connecting grantors, (i.e. individuals willing to make donations to further science, research and innovation on topics that benefit all humankind), with grantees (i.e. individuals willing to complete interesting research and development for minimal pay to further learn, grow, and further human knowledge).

# Grants
Grants can be found in the 'grants' directory. Each grant consists of an 'OVERVIEW.md' describing the overall goal of the grant, with an ordered set of task overviews and acceptance criteria for each R&D task.

The grant directory will then have a T1-<name>.md, T2-<name>.md, etc. providing detailed description, acceptance criteria, and advice from the grantor and/or steward/expert responsible for managing the grant. 

Finally, an AUDIT-LOG.md contains all information regarding when the grant was posted, who is the current grantor/steward, any assigned/in-progress grantee(s), and notes about any potentially partially completed work on the grant.
